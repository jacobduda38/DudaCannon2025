Abstract:
In fMRI experiments, the basal ganglia is consistently activated by rhythmic action and
sensorimotor synchronization to a metronome, and conditions like Parkinson’s Disease that
affect basal ganglia and its dopaminergic modulation are experimentally seen to affect
performance on both types of task. However, it is not clear what role this circuit or dopaminergic
modulation play during rhythm production and synchronization tasks. Here, we propose that the
basal ganglia may specify, maintain, and adapt the tempo with which rhythmic action (e.g. finger
tapping or walking) is performed. We build a model based on previous “action selection” models
of the cortico-basal-ganglia loop, altered such that cortico-basal-ganglia loops correspond not to
distinct actions but to a continuum of possible action tempi. During rhythm production, an initial
tempo is selected by cortical input, and rhythmic action can be automatized to continue in the
absence of cortical input if tonic dopamine levels in striatum are sufficiently high. When striatal
dopamine is reduced, our model reproduces two key features of dopamine deprivation in
Parkinson’s disease: freezing of gait, and increased variation in produced intertap intervals
during rhythmic tapping. By reanalyzing data from a recent experiment with Parkinsonian
patients, we confirm the model’s prediction that increased interval variability should be largely
attributable to increased tempo drift (rather than, e.g., increased timekeeper noise). This model
of rhythm production is the first to invoke specific features of basal ganglia circuitry. It augments
existing models of action selection in basal ganglia with the addition of continuous action
parameters, and in doing so provides a starting point for further modeling of action timing and
rhythm in the motor system. It offers a new model of the mechanism by which rhythmic auditory
stimulation supports gait in Parkinson’s patients, and makes a new, testable prediction about
sensorimotor synchronization under conditions of low tonic dopamine.
